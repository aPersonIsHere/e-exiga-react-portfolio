        I love game making and putting ideas into a computer screen. I enjoy game making so much, that I have used unconventional methods to express my creativity. Many boast of making games in Unity or in C++, but have they tried using unconventional programming languages such as Scratch or Minecraft Datapacks? It is undeniable that full-scale programming languages make complete and professional games, but I like a challenge. I hit many limitations with low-complexity languages, but I use problem-solving skills to find workarounds, sometimes making things more exciting than originally planned. Its exciting to see a project come to life by piecing together smaller systems to create one great product. I also enjoy improving with what is not great on its own, optimization, and fixing bugs.

        Currently, I am a student in the UT Austin Bootcamp and learning to become a full-stack web developer. It is imperative that a web developer knows how to make a site and create a custom back-end server that interacts with the website since two go hand-to-hand.
